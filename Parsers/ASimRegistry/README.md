# The Azure Sentinel Information Model (ASIM) Registry parsers

This folder includes the the Azure Sentinel Information Model (ASIM) Registry parsers. The parsers are provided in YAML and in ARM template formats. The latter can be used to deploy the parsers, while the former is provided for educational purposes. 

The Azure Sentinel Information Mode (ASIM) enables you to use and create source-agnostic content, simplifying your analysis of the data in your Azure Sentinel workspace.
